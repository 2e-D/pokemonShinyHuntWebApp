      <h3> How do I find a shiny pokemon </h3>
      <p>Fiding a shiny pokemon is not easy, in Generation 2 - 5 you have a 1 in 8192 chance to encounter one through normal gameplay, now whilst there are a few the game gifts you, like The red Gyarados in Generation 2 and the remakes, trying to encounter one can be very daunting for some players</p>

      <h3>Why would i want to find one</h3>
      <p>Shiny Pokemon are a major part of peoples time spent on these games, whilst it may seem difficult to find one, many people enjoy the thrill of trying to find one and will spend hours at a time searching for them, and once you find one that ignites the urge to want to find as many as possible</p>

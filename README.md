# pokemonShinyHuntWebApp
This is my first real use case web application. I spend alot of time playing pokemon as it is so why not make a app to track what shinys i have encountered and how many encounters it took me to catch one.


I plan on completing this app over the months i am learning programming and plan to eventually upload it to the google play store so other people can enjoy the easiness of shiny hunting with this app


Features added / Things i've done so far
 
 - Succesfully called the api
 - Can change the pokemon displayed by changing the name in app.js file
 - Displays the shiny sprites of said pokemon from pokeAPI
 - Added a counter to track encounters
 - Background and Greeting text changes based on time of day
 - Added an 'Enter' Page
 - Added an 'About Me' with moving sprites


Features i need to add

- Search Bar that works with pokemon name
- Animated sprites
- moving background on main page (This became changing backgrounds based on time)
- Save the number of encounters
- (big feature) eventually add a collection page that marks how many shines you have out of all 915 pokemon
- Pull data from the twitter API to show peoples latest shiny encounters from all over the world

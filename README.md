# pokemonShinyHuntWebApp
This is my first real use case web application. I spend alot of time playing pokemon as it is so why not make a app to track what shinys i have encountered and how many encounters it took me to catch one.


I plan on completing this app over the months i am learning programming and plan to eventually upload it to the google play store so other people can enjoy the easiness of shiny hunting with this app


Features added so far
 
 - succesfully called the api
 - can change the pokemon displayed by changing the ID number in app.js file
 - Displays the shiny sprites of said pokemon
 - Added a counter to track encounters
 -


Features i need to add

- Search Bar
- Animated sprites
- moving background on main page
- Save the number of encounters
- (big feature) eventually add a collection page that marks how many shines you have out of all 915 pokeon

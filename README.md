# pokemonShinyHuntWebApp
This is my first real use case web application. I spend alot of time playing pokemon as it is so why not make a app to track what shinys i have encountered and how many encounters it took me to catch one.


I plan on completing this app over the months i am learning programming and plan to eventually upload it to the google play store so other people can enjoy the easiness of shiny hunting with this app
